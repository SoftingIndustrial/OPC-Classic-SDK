## **Step 2 - Customizing the Application**


The next steps will explain the structure of the supplied project and will tell you how to extend its functionality.

This part describes how to add application-specific implementations.

###  Microsoft Visual Studio 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010

In the installed tutorial, the paths for the Include and Library files have been set according to the directory structure of the installation. If you have changed this structure or want to generate the tutorial in a different directory, you have to change the settings.

You will find the corresponding forms in the figures below.

Please make sure that you choose "All configurations" when setting the directories for the header files. You will reach the forms via the menu item Project->Properties.

### Brief explanation on the generated classes


The generated project contains 3 classes: **MyAeSession**, **MyAeSubscription** and **OpcClient**. The first two classes are defined only using a header file and for the last one a header and a source file exists. The name of the header and source files coincide with the class name.

The first two classes represent OPC objects: session and subscription and can be extended to add extra functionality to the generated project.

The **OpcClient** class contains a small number of methods that are needed to create a functional OPC client. It has methods for initializing (**initialize**) and terminating (**terminate**) the application, tracing the application (**trace**), processing CommandLine (**processCommandLine**) and setting the service name in case the OPC client needs to be run as a service **setServiceName**. The other methods are used for creating and initializing OPC objects (**initializeAeObjects**) and for getting the state of a given condition.(**getConditionState**)

When running the project, an instance of the **OpcClient** class is created and then the application is initialized. You can see this below:

```
// create the OpcClient instance
createOpcClient();
OpcClient* pClient = getOpcClient();

if(!SUCCEEDED(pClient->initialize()))
{
    pClient->terminate();
    destroyOpcClient();

    CloseHandle(g_endEvent);
    return 1;
}
```


After the application was succesfully initialized its time to create the OPC objects. This is done by calling the **initializeAeObjects** method. It creates a session and a subscription object and then connects them.

In this moment operations on the created objects can be performed. e.g getting the state of a given condition state, receiving events...

How to do this you can see in the next step.
